### Side notes:
- IoT example
- https://github.audio/
- Pokemon GO failures
- Beer example
- live coding
- funny agenda (confusing theory etc.)

### Pluses of Node (in context of microservices):
- redeploy one service instead of whole stack
- APIs rule - you get functionality from it
- Apps nowadays - API consumers
- evolving
- easiness of deployment
- highly scalable (stateless apps)
- NPM
- lightweight
- performance
- JS
- Good PaaS providers

- non-blocking IO
- no need for multi threading

- API glue
- easy to learn
- modern


### Minuses of Node:
- automation
- ops
- no clear messaging patterns


### Why Node
- top 4 in cloud
- async from roots, not built on top of sync model
- Community is the reason
